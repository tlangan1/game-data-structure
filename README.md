- See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39488788/how-to-make-a-menu-in-python-navigable-with-arrow-keys) answer from FocusedWolf. It was the last answer the last I looked.

- In my case the keyboard value for the arrow keys are as follows:
  - arrow up is 450 or curses.KEY_A2
  - arrow left is 452 or curses.KEY_B1
  - arrow down is 456 or curses.KEY_C2
  - arrow right is 454 or curses.KEY_B3
  - the enter key maps correctly
